This project downloads every order from your [GrubHub](http://www.grubhub.com/) account and displays the data in aggregate. The goal was to determine how much money I've spent in total ordering out, and how frequently I order from each location.

The code may be a little sloppy, but I was probably hungry at the time it was written.
