This is a combination of several experiments:

* Representing an application primarily with XML, rendered with XSL
    * The inspiration for this was the old Blizzard WoW Armory
* Handling postbacks
    * Have input fields and other form elements preserve their values after a form submission
* Workflow
    * Configurable workflow which can trigger actions to manipulate content
* Event listeners
    * To allow arbitrary objects the ability to contextually react to workflow actions, instead of hard-coding custom logic for every possible consumer within the workflow action itself
