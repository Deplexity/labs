This is a small script I hacked together to download and display all movies
I've rated on Netflix. Their API doesn't expose user ratings, so you need to download the 
full catalog and request user ratings for every movie in their library. As expected, this creates
a lot of extra leg work, and the final solution I ended up with is far from ideal.

This is not intended for general use.
