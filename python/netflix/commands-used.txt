API request: /catalog/titles/full
This will throw an exception but give URL to file with full list of titles

Example:
curl http://cdn-api.netflix.com/api/full_catalog_3.xml?token= > netflix.txt

Create a file containing all movie URL's:
grep '<id>' netflix.txt | grep -Po 'http://.[^<]*' > netflix-titles.txt

Split the file into parts (API limitation):
split -l 50 -a 3 netflix-titles.txt titles/

Retrieve ratings from Netflix:
find titles/* -exec python ratings.py {} \; >> ratings.txt

Monitor progress in real time:
tail -f ratings.txt

Output final results:
grep '{' ratings.txt > final-ratings.txt

Put lines from final-ratings.txt into tojson.py to generate the JSON
python tojson.py > netflix.json
